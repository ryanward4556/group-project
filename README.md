# Event Finder
### (Group Project-1)

## Summary

This application will help you plan events for your next trip. Using the TicketMaster and Eventful API's, we take the date range and the city you select and find all of the events pertaining to your dates and and city. Each search is saved to a Firebase database, which can be used for future improvements to save searches for different users

### Technologies Used: 
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* Firebase

### API's Used: 
* TicketMaster
* Eventful

## My Responsibilities

I was on the back-end team, specifically in charge of handling the AJAX requests to the API's and passing that data to the front end team in a digestible form. 

## Challenges

The main challenges sprouted from making a simultaneous requests to two event API's which gave us back different data, and being able to present both of those sets of event data in a uniform format. 

One of the issues related to this was displaying photos for each event, as some were large, some tiny, and some did not have photos associated with them (which is the ipod shuffle default image you'll see for some events).
